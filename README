Introduction
---------------
WiMP is a robust and easy to use media player for Linux and
perhaps other POSIX like systems. It aims for stability and
low system resources as requirements.

System Requirements
---------------------
It should run on anything that can run X. 32 MB RAM, 400 MHz
processor, some free space. I developed it on 256 MB RAM,
1.5 GHz Pentium 4, Fedora Core 4.

Software Requirements
------------------------
Gtk+-2.0
Libxine

It should work on old ( ~ 2004 ) distros. I developed it on
Fedora Core 4.

Compiling and Running
------------------------
To compile, you'll need devel packages of everything from
Xorg to Gtk+-2.0 and libxine

to compile, do
$ make

to run, do
$ ./wimp

There is no need to "install" it anywhere. Just move the
wimp binary to ~/bin and you should be good to go.

Bugs
-----
Of course. And, some of them are complimentary.
Mail 'em to me. I'll take a look.
