[ Wimp FAQ ]
$ Revision Saturday, May 15 2010 $

Q. Why Wimp ?
A. Why not.

Q. When I use the equalizer, volume goes way low.
A. The Xine Amp kicks in to prevent clipping (?). Use the
   "Amp level" on the "Audio" tab to boost volume.

Q. Where are the equalizer presets ?
A. Equalizer presets are only available in the full version
   of wimp, which costs ten trillion dollars.
  
Q. Which video / audio output driver should I use ?
A. Use xv + alsa for optimum performance, or select "auto"
   to let xine decide what's best.

Q. Who's this lady you keep referring to?
A. I'm not gonna tell you.

Q. I wanna donate.
A. Keep your $.99. I don't want it.

Q. What's the system requirement?
A. Anything that can run X. 32 MB of RAM, 350 MHz processor,
   couple of MB's of free space ...

Q. How come so low?
A. That's what I have. I'm poor.

Q. But my foo player requires 10GB of ram. Surely it must have
   better features?
A. Surely.

Q. If you've used Gtk+-2.0 and libxine, both high level libraries,
   brilliantly object oriented in native C, how much did you contribute
   to this project on your own ?
A. Umm ....

Q. My god the player runs stable and fast. Can I send you a picture
   of myself as a thank you gift? I'm a russian super model.
A. Finally!

Q. Your player is stupid.
A. Hm.

Q. Did she really not call you on April the 18th ?
A. Swear to god she did not. And, I waited for 3 years, right next
   to the phone.

Q. What about LADSPA and some really cool audio effects that'll make
   my average speakers sound nicer.
A. Unfortunately, xine has no LADSPA support as yet. You have the
   compressor for now. Either I'll wait for somebody to put in ladspa
   in xine, or try to implement it myself.

Q. What does "TV Mode" do?
A. I wished I knew.

Q. I want more features.
A. You'll have them soon.

Q. Now that I've used it, the player seems really usable.
A. Hm.

Q. It don't play ( properly ) some codec.
A. That's a libxine thing. Update your xine libraries.

Q. Can wimp open my media player's playlists?
A. You can try.

Q. What's the "emergency exit" strategy?
A. It aborts the player immediately, irrespective of whatever it's
   doing. So, if you have a slow system, and you're watching some HD
   "news" video size 720x480 and, well, hit escape and it goes away.
   No gaurantees ( try the realtime Linux patch ), but it should make
   the player exit immediately.
